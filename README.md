# Movie-Sucess-Predication-using-R
The lecture project and the lab project are generally similar.
The lab project is written in R and tries to predict movie
success with respect to rating. The csv on the lecture project
has removed the year column and added the attendance column
(which is the column against which movie success is predicted.)
